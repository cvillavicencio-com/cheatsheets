*** Special Diary Entries
If you want to make a diary entry that applies to the anniversary of a specific date, move point to that date and use the i a command. This displays the end of your diary file in another window and inserts the anniversary description; you can then type the rest of the diary entry. The entry looks like this: 
#+BEGIN_SRC
%%(diary-anniversary 10 31 1988) Arthur's birthday
#+END_SRC
This entry applies to October 31 in any year after 1988; ‘10 31 1988’ specifies the date. (If you are using the European or ISO calendar style, the input order of month, day and year is different.) The reason this expression requires a beginning year is that advanced diary functions can use it to calculate the number of elapsed years. 

§

A block diary entry applies to a specified range of consecutive dates. Here is a block diary entry that applies to all dates from June 24, 2012 through July 10, 2012:

#+BEGIN_SRC
%%(diary-block 6 24 2012 7 10 2012) Vacation
#+END_SRC

This entry applies to October 31 in any year after 1988; ‘10 31 1988’ specifies the date. (If you are using the European or ISO calendar style, the input order of month, day and year is different.) The reason this expression requires a beginning year is that advanced diary functions can use it to calculate the number of elapsed years. 

§

Cyclic diary entries repeat after a fixed interval of days. To create one, select the starting date and use the i c command. The command prompts for the length of interval, then inserts the entry, which looks like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC
%%(diary-cyclic 50 3 1 2012) Renew medication
#+END_SRC

This entry applies to March 1, 2012 and every 50th day following; ‘3 1 2012’ specifies the starting date. (If you are using the European or ISO calendar style, the input order of month, day and year is different.)

All three of these commands make marking diary entries. To insert a nonmarking entry, give a prefix argument to the command. For example, C-u i a makes a nonmarking anniversary diary entry.

Marking sexp diary entries in the calendar can be time-consuming, since every date visible in the calendar window must be individually checked. So it’s a good idea to make sexp diary entries nonmarking (with ‘&’) when possible.

Another sophisticated kind of sexp entry, a floating diary entry, specifies a regularly occurring event by offsets specified in days, weeks, and months. It is comparable to a crontab entry interpreted by the cron utility. Here is a nonmarking, floating diary entry that applies to the fourth Thursday in November:

#+BEGIN_SRC
&%%(diary-float 11 4 4) American Thanksgiving
#+END_SRC

The 11 specifies November (the eleventh month), the 4 specifies Thursday (the fourth day of the week, where Sunday is numbered zero), and the second 4 specifies the fourth Thursday (1 would mean “first”, 2 would mean “second”, -2 would mean “second-to-last”, and so on). The month can be a single month or a list of months. Thus you could change the 11 above to ‘'(1 2 3)’ and have the entry apply to the last Thursday of January, February, and March. If the month is t, the entry applies to all months of the year.

#+BEGIN_SRC
%%(diary-offset '(diary-float t 3 4) 2) Monthly committee meeting
#+END_SRC

This entry applies to the Saturday after the third Thursday of each month. The 2 specifies number of days after when the sexp '(diary-float t 3 4) would evaluate to t. This is useful when for example your organization has a committee meeting two days after every monthly meeting which takes place on the third Thursday, or if you would like to attend a virtual meeting scheduled in a different timezone causing a difference in the date.

Each of the standard sexp diary entries takes an optional parameter specifying the name of a face or a single-character string to use when marking the entry in the calendar. Most generally, sexp diary entries can perform arbitrary computations to determine when they apply.
